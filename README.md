n8n Learning ep 1
Goal: Understand what n8n is and its basic concepts.

🌟 What is n8n?</br>
n8n (pronounced "n-eight-n") is a powerful workflow automation platform that enables you to integrate APIs, services, and databases using a no-code/low-code interface.</br>
It's like having your own customizable automation engine for cloud, CI/CD, alerts, infrastructure monitoring, and more!</br>

🛠 Why I'm Learning n8n for DevOps
Here’s how I plan to use n8n in DevOps automation:

🔔 Monitor Infrastructure: Auto-alerts when AWS EC2 status changes or resource limits are crossed.

🐙 GitHub Integration: Auto-create or comment on issues when a build fails.

🧪 CI/CD Hooks: Trigger Slack or Telegram messages when a deployment finishes.

📈 Observability: Collect and forward logs or metrics to tools like Grafana or ELK.

📤 Backups & Reports: Automate daily/weekly cloud storage backups or generate reports.
